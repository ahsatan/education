; PROBLEM A
; 
; Design a data definition RocketDescent to represent a rocket's journey as it descends 
; from 100 kilometers to Earth. Once the rocket has landed it is done.
; 



; 
; PROBLEM B
; 
; Design a function rocket-descent-to-msg that will output the rocket's
; remaining descent distance in a short string that can be broadcast. 
; When the descent is over, the message should be "The rocket has landed!".
